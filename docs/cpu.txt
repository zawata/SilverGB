The CPU

The CPU is slightly customized Intel 8080 with some nifty features from the zilog z80.

The 8080 was the precursor to the 8086 which was the precursor to the 8086,
    the starting point of the x86 CPU architecture

The zilog z80 is still in use today, the most common application I see for it is
    the Texas Instrument's Graphic Calculators. All of them (Ti-81+) use the z80 as 
    their CPU


Execution is as follows:
 - each Instruction Execution is dubbed an I-Cycle
    Execution of instructions is completely linear
 - each I-cycle consists of a number of M-Cycles depending on the complexity of the instruction
    There are between 1 and 5 M-Cycles per I-Cycle
 - each M-Cycle consists of a number of T-Cycles(z80) or states(8080) (herein referred to as T-Cycles for consistency and simplicity)
    A T-Cycle is simply the pulse of a clock
    There are between 3 and 5 T-cycles per M-Cycle depending on the complexity of the M-Cycle


 - T-Cycle may not be neccessary to emulate as no additional execution may happen
    to the level of a T-Cycle.


The M-Cycles
    1. FETCH
        The first and most obvious of the M-Cycles, FETCH, is the retrieval and
        decoding the OpCode.
        This is always the first M-Cycle and will execute for every instruction
    2. MEMORY READ
    3. MEMORY WRITE
